  "description": "This project (yet unnamed) is planned to be an open-source and intuitive database for college admissions offices to use for event management, email communications, and application review. Resources like [Slate](https://technolutions.com/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/education/recruitment-admissions-software/), [Keap](https://keap.com/solutions/automation), and many others are powerful, but it would be super awesome if there was a free and open-source alternative which still had the capabilities that admissions offices need:\r * manage campus visits and provide a public-facing registration portal\r * schedule and send emails to prospective students and applicants\r * track application materials\r * query applicant records\r * hopefully other features!",
