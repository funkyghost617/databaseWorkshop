# College Admissions Database Project
This project (yet unnamed) is planned to be an open-source and intuitive database for college admissions offices to use for event management, email communications, and application review. Resources like [Slate](https://technolutions.com/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/education/recruitment-admissions-software/), [Keap](https://keap.com/solutions/automation), and many others are powerful, but it would be super awesome if there was a free and open-source alternative which still had the capabilities that admissions offices need:
* manage campus visits and provide a public-facing registration portal
* schedule and send emails to prospective students and applicants
* track application materials
* query applicant records
* hopefully other features!

The end goal of this project is to publish an open-source repository for colleges use on their own websites, as well as intuitive and accessible documentation for how to setup the database and file management systems.

The latest version of the project is live at [this website](https://funkyghost617backend--databaseworkshop.us-central1.hosted.app/).
You can also take a look at this repository for any other project files or unfinished versions.

Current project focus: designing a query building interface which saves compound queries to a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database and running those queries with Javascript
